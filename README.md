# Overview

{A character that will run on the MUGEN game engine, the character idea is from "K'" from KOF.}

{I'm wrote this character so that I can have my own character that I can play rather than play other people's character that I don't even know what the feature are, and I can control my own character and add things to it that can make me win and bring joy, if other people interest, I'm glad to share and I can explain what I put inside if they are confuse.}

# Future Work
* Add more staff, like more flame work.
* Maybe make an AI for my character if I decide to put in public
* organize code and variable better and make a list of variable sheet so that I can remember which variable is use for
* Add more comment in English version so that when other people read my character they will understand, but I need to understand how it called in english first.
